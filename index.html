        <p> Welcome to Diety! Diety is a Greek mythology themed roguelike game! You have been chosen to be an early game
            tester!
            In Diety, you enter a dungeon as a mortal, and your goal is to climb your way down towards the bottom. Each
            floor will
            include new enemies, new items, and new challenges. You will have to fight your way through the dungeon, and
            defeat everything
            in your path.
